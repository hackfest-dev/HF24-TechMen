# Neonatal Sleep Monitoring using Optical Flow (RAFT)

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a system for monitoring sleep in neonates using optical flow techniques, particularly the RAFT (Optical Flow with Occlusions) algorithm. Neonatal sleep monitoring is crucial for assessing the health and well-being of infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and can provide valuable insights into their development and potential issues.

## Features

- Non-invasive monitoring of neonatal sleep patterns
- High temporal resolution for detailed analysis of movement patterns and sleep stages
- Accuracy in motion estimation, even in challenging scenarios such as occlusions
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Objective assessment of sleep stages through quantified movement patterns
- Early identification of conditions like sleep apnea through abnormal sleep patterns
- Support for longitudinal studies by enabling continuous and automated monitoring over extended periods

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- RAFT (Optical Flow with Occlusions) library
- Webcam or camera for capturing neonatal sleep footage
